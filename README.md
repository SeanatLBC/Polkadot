# Polkadot
Polkadot is built to connect private and consortium chains, public and permissionless networks, oracles, and future technologies that are yet to be created. Polkadot facilitates an internet where independent blockchains can exchange information and transactions in a trustless way via the Polkadot relay chain.

Polkadot empowers blockchain networks to work together under the protection of shared security. Founded by some of the blockchain industry’s foremost builders like Dr. Gavin Wood.  Polkadot is a platform with low barriers to entry for flexible, autonomous economies acting together within Polkadot’s shared security umbrella. This is an open-source project founded by the Web3 Foundation


What problems is Polkadot solving?  At a high level, here are the problems we are attempting to solve:

Interoperability

In the future, we see a world filled with diverse blockchains all serving specific and unique purposes. Currently, these blockchain networks exist in isolation with no communication or interoperability between them. This is an existential problem that needs to be addressed in order for a truly trustless ecosystem to develop and thrive. Polkadot is designed to enable applications and smart contracts on one blockchain to seamlessly transact with data and assets on other chains.

Scalability

Currently transactions are processed one-by-one on network nodes, creating a bottleneck as more transactions try to make their way through the network. Polkadot gives the ability to run several parachains (see below), each processing multiple transactions in parallel, which allows networks to obtain infinite scalability.

Shared Security

Chains naturally compete with each other over security resources. They then squander it. With Polkadot, security is pooled within the network, which means that individual chains can leverage collective security without having to start from scratch to gain traction and trust. This means if you want to call a smart contract on completely different chain, you can trust the validity of that chain's contract with the same assurance as an ETH contract trusting another ETH contract.

How will this be accomplished technically?
Polkadot consists of many parachains with potentially differing characteristics which can make it easier to achieve anonymity or formal verification. Transactions can be spread out across the chains, allowing many more to be processed in the same period of time. Polkadot ensures that each of these blockchains remains secure and that any dealings between them are faithfully executed. Specialised parachains called bridges can be created to link independent chains.

Relay chain

The core chain that coordinates consensus and transaction delivery between chains.

Parachains

Constituent blockchains within the Polkadot ecosystem which gather and process transactions. A parachain is essentially a customizable blockchain built on Polkadot that is flexible, cost-efficient, and secure.

Bridges

Link to blockchains with their own consensus such as Ethereum
